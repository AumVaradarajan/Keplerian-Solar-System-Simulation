# Keplerian-Solar-System-Simulation
used python to code the solar system using orbital elements from wikipedia like inclination, eccentricity, longitude of ascending node, argument of perihelion, orbital velocity and so on to make a keplerian model of the solar system. there is also a barycenter calculator that shows the barycenter position with distance, colour coded vector contributions at any given date fairly accurately. 
libraries used: ffmpegwriter, matplotlib
solarsystem3d contains the code.
